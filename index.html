      <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Two Breweries Hill Race" /></span>
      <p> The Two Breweries was established in 1983, making it one
        of the oldest hill races in Scotland. The race is held on
        the 4th Saturday in September, starting on the lawn in
        front of the courtyard gates
        at <a href="http://www.traquair.co.uk">Traquair House</a> at 12 noon and finishing in front
        of <a href="https://broughtonales.co.uk">Broughton
        Ales</a> brewery. </p>
      <p> The record (2:33:57) was set by John Taylor in 1991.  John
        was an international athlete who died in 2002, aged 33,
        from a heart condition known as cardiomyopathy.
        The <a href="http://www.johntaylorfoundation.org.uk/">John
        Taylor Foundation</a> was created to raise awareness of
        this condition, and to assist young athletes. The women's
        record (2:53:56) was set by Angela Mudge in 2000. Results
        from previous years can be found
        on <a href="http://www.scottishhillracing.co.uk/RaceDetails.aspx?RaceID=RA-0103">www.scottishhillracing.co.uk</a>. </p>

      <h2 class="major">The route</h2>
      <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="Two Breweries Hill Race" /></span>
      <p> The race is around 30km / 18 miles, and includes some 1500m /
        4900ft of ascent. The terrain predominantly follows hill
        tracks, but includes sections of open heather with some
        short sections along country roads. </p>
      <p> This race is an arduous event which should not be
        undertaken by runners who are unfit, or are inexperienced
        in the hills. Full emergency kit comprising wind and
        waterproof full body cover, a map of the entire race
        route, orienteering-type compass, whistle and food
        equivalent to a chocolate bar must be carried by all
        runners. Runners must be at least 18 years old. </p>
      <p> There are eight marshalled checkpoints. Water is available
        at Glenrath Farm and Stobo Home Farm. These checkpoints
        are also retiral points. Hill rescue cover is provided by <a href="http://moffatmrt.scottishmountainrescue.org">Moffat
        Mountain Rescue</a>.</p>

      <p> We are also delighted to be associated
        with <a href="http://tweedgreen.org/">Tweedgreen</a>, a

        use and waste. </p>
      <p> Locals taking part will appreciate the beauty and
        interests of the Scottish Borders. Those coming from
